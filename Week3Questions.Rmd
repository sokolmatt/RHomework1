First, I will read in the data set.

Second, we will delete all columns except the column indicating edible or poisonous and those related to the cap of the mushroom.

Third, we will keep only the first 25 rows of data.

Will rename variables then using the gdata R package

```{r}
getwd()
MushroomsData = read.csv("Mushrooms_Dataset.csv")
MushroomsData = MushroomsData[-c(1,6:24)]
MushroomsData = MushroomsData[-seq(nrow(MushroomsData),nrow(MushroomsData)-8098),]
theDF <- data.frame(MushroomsData)
names(theDF) <- c("Edible or Poisonous", "Cap Shape", "Cap Surface", "Cap Color")
theDF

```
